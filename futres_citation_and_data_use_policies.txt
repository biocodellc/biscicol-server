The FuTRES data store contains data from member projects
Please refer to the following data usage and citation policies for each data source when using this data in your research.

# GEOME data sources
GEOME projects each have their own data policy.  We have not yet implemented an automated script
to display individual project information, instead you may refer directly to GEOME and search for individual 
projects under the GEOME team for particular data usage policies.  See https://www.geome-db.org/
